## Overview

This project is developed based on publicly shared resources from **LG Electronics R&D Vietnam ‚Äì Da Nang branch**, serving training and research activities at the **LG-DUT Cybersecurity Lab**.

It focuses on building a **custom WebOS** embedded on **Raspberry Pi 4**, integrating key Linux security features to enhance embedded system security ‚Äî especially for **automotive** and **edge devices**.

## Key Features

- üîß **Customized WebOS Build**  
  Modular OS build system tailored for Raspberry Pi 4.

- üîê **Security Integration**
  - **Firewall**: Configured using `nftables` to filter traffic, detect threats, and prevent unauthorized access.
  - **SMACK (Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel)**: Enforces mandatory access control at the kernel level.

## Objectives

- Strengthen the security of embedded Linux-based systems
- Provide a hands-on learning platform for security in automotive and IoT environments
- Demonstrate practical integration of open-source Linux security features

## Applications

This system is suitable for:
- Automotive control units (ECUs)
- Edge computing devices
- Secure gateways in IoT environments
